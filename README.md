It's the same as the other Unix source compilers but this time I wrote one in golang as it compiles very fast and has very powerful libraries.

# About Unix (short)
Unix is an Operating System developed in 1969 by two Bell Labs developers, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson.  Originally, Unix was used internally by Bell Labs employees.  It wasn't until the late 1970s when At&t licensed Unix to outside parties.  This would lead to many commercial and education institutes making their own Unix variant such as the University of California Berkeley with BSD, Microsoft with Xenix, IBM with AIX, and Sun Microsystems with SunOS.
